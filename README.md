# GameBoyScroll
A project written in Z80 assembly to be run on a Nintendo Game Boy. The VisualBoyAdvance emulator is included in the repository. Simply open the run the wide_map.gb ROM in VBA to see it in action. It simply loads a map into VRAM and scrolls it in a loop on every VBlank. Very basic, but it was an interesting introduction to assembly language programming.
